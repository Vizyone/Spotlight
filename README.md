## Overview
### Description 
An App to promote events and sale tickets. Planners can post event on and have control on how many tickets are being sold on the platform and can validate purchased tickets on the event day. Simple users can view events on the platform and make reservations by buying or not.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:**
    Entertainment, marketing, promotional and Social
- **Mobile:**
    Available only on android device for now.
- **Story:**
    Spotlight is designed to promote events in any category and type, will sale tickets and give Planner access to post their events, get access to a dashboard to visualize data on sold tickets and can validate purchased tickets on the events day.
- **Market:**
    People of any age and gender, from every social category, who use smart devices and want to go to events  but would like to purchase tickets on their smart device in their home or office comfort or elsewhere.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as users want to check out on new events or get information on how many events  available to participate to. 
- **Scope:** First, we want to give a better way both to event planners to expose their events and event custommers to know about events and make reservations easier. Afterwards, perhaps we will be able to put more information about  artists and where events will be hosted introducing google map. We will also continue to make it easier for users and planners to navigate and get more advantage using Spotlight.
